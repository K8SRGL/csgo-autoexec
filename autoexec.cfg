// Sparks' CS:GO Config
// Hey, if you're reading this, then you've decided to give my config a shot, awesome!
// Just FYI, this config isn't "pro" or "the best config ever made", but it's what I use and what I find comfortable. So, bleh. :p
// Also you should probably use these lanuch options (at least as a base) "-novid -nojoy -nosteamcontroller -primarysound -snoforceformat -nohltv -limitvsconst -fullscreen -w 1280 -h 960 -threads 16 -noforcemparms -noforcemaccel -high -d3dex -r_emulate_gl +exec autoexec.cfg"
